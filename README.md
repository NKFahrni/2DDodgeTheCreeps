# 2DDodgeTheCreeps
First Godot Game that I made with the help of the Godot Tutorial "dodge the creeps!"
This is all just a follow along with the tutorial project. Nothing new it is all as it is in the tutorial. 
## Lessons learned?
Yes deffenitly learned quite a lot of things this small project didn't take all to long and had great explanation for a lot of the things you needed to do. As well as the Visual help so if I didn't know if I did it correctly I was able to check with the pictures in the tutorial.
